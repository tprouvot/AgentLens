# AgentLens

Understand what your Agentforce agent actually did — visually.

## What it does

Load a trace from the **Agentforce DX** extension, the **NGA builder**, or the **SF CLI** and AgentLens shows you:

- **Agent Graph** — which sub agents talked to each other, how many times, and in what order
- **Finite State Machine** — the internal orchestration flow for each sub agent: LLM calls, tool executions, variable mutations, and handoffs
- **Step-by-Step Inspector** — walk through every event with full detail: system prompts, model output, tool inputs/outputs, and variable diffs
- **Graph Analysis Report** — one-click PDF with degree distribution, connectivity analysis, betweenness centrality, and algorithm explanations

## Getting a Trace

AgentLens accepts trace JSON from any of these sources:

| Source | How to get the trace |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Agentforce Builder** | Open your agent in Setup > Agentforce Builder, run a conversation in the Preview panel, then copy the JSON trace from the conversation details |
| **SF CLI — Agent Preview** | `sf agent preview -o <org>` — after the conversation, save the transcript JSON (saved to `./temp/agent-preview` by default, or specify `--output-dir`) |
| **Agentforce DX Extension** | Use the trace viewer in the Agentforce DX VS Code extension and copy the plan response JSON |

## Quick Start

### Web App

1. Open <https://msrivastav13.github.io/AgentLens/> (or `index.html` locally — no server required)
2. Paste or upload a trace JSON from any of the sources above
3. The first sub agent is auto-selected — step through the trace with arrow keys or the prev/next buttons; handoffs navigate to the next agent automatically

### Chrome Extension

1. Open `chrome://extensions` and enable **Developer mode**
2. Click **Load unpacked** and select the `chrome-extension/` folder
3. Navigate to the NGA builder in your Salesforce org
4. Click **Copy Code** to copy the trace, then click the **Open in AgentLens** button that appears next to it
5. A new tab opens with the full trace visualization

The extension injects a button directly into the NGA builder UI for one-click trace viewing.

### VS Code Extension

1. Build the extension: `cd vscode-extension && npm install && npm run package`
2. Install the generated `.vsix` file in VS Code (Extensions > Install from VSIX)
3. Open a trace JSON file — AgentLens activates automatically

The extension provides the same visualization inside VS Code with native theme integration.

## Why

Agentforce traces are large JSON blobs. Reading them raw is painful. AgentLens turns them into something you can actually navigate — so you can debug handoff loops, understand why an LLM chose a tool, or figure out where latency is hiding.

Zero dependencies. Runs entirely in the browser. Works offline. Available as a web app, Chrome extension, and VS Code extension.
